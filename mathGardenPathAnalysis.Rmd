Path Analysis Of Math Garden Data, Mark 1
========================================================

This document is a first attempt to do a path analysis of the Math Garden data collected in the spring, summer, and fall of 2012.  The idea here is simply to evaluate what kind of structure we can easily glean from students; in particular, we want to evaluate the kinds of learning trajectories that are representative of successful or unsuccessful students.


```{r "requires", echo=FALSE}
require(plyr)
require(ggplot2)

```


```{r "Load and Prep Data", echo=FALSE}
wd <- "/Users/dlandy/Dropbox/Projects/Math\ Garden/"
setwd(wd)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
